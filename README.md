Hi, I’m Arun Das!

I am a scientist working in computer science and genomics.  I’m interested in algorithms for the analysis of large genomic data, diversity and representation in genomics, cryptography and privacy, and football (soccer) analytics!

I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Genome Sciences, at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Previously, I was a PhD student in the Schatz Lab, in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins University, and an undergraduate in the Computer Science Department at Brown University, advised by Dr. Sorin Istrail.

If you have any questions about my work, or just want to get in touch, you can find me on Bluesky (@arun-das.bsky.social), or check out my website (arun96.github.io).
