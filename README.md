Hi, I’m Arun Das (@arun96)! I'm a PhD student in the Schatz Lab, in the Computer Science Department @ Johns Hopkins University.
I’m interested in algorithms for the analysis of large genomic data, diversity and representation in genomics, cryptography and privacy, and football (soccer) analytics!
If you have any questions about my work, or just want to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter (@arun_genomics), or check out my website (linked in my bio).
